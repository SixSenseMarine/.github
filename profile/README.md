## Developer Guidelines

The [SixSense Marine](https://github.com/SixSenseMarine) repositories are not open-source but subject to the [license terms](https://github.com/SixSenseMarine/.github/blob/main/profile/LICENSE.md) unless expressly noted otherwise. *Please secure the IP that you download and do not share it unless permission has been obtained.*

All these repositories form part of commercial products and development of the codebase must contribute towards the commercial objectives and the feature roadmap of the [SixSense Marine](https://github.com/SixSenseMarine) product manager(s). Pull requests will only be considered if they are on the approved product backlog. *Before forking any repository and starting work on it, approval must be obtained from the administrator for the new features or changes.*

Contributors to the [SixSense Marine](https://github.com/SixSenseMarine) codebase should follow these guidelines to ensure that the codebase remains consistent. 

## Style Guide

The style guidelines below should be implemented. An example of code that conforms to these guidelines is shown [below](#code-example).

### Folders and Files

The following guidelines must be followed in setting up a project or creating new code files:

* The [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) project structure must be used for all libraries. When starting a new library, us the SixSense Marine [PioTemplate.h](https://github.com/SixSenseMarine/PioTemplate/blob/main/lib/PioTemplate/include/PioTemplate.h).
* All classes must have seperate declaration files in the `/lib/MyLibrary/include/` folder with the definition in the `/lib/MyLibrary/src/` folder.
* Each class, struct and enum must have its own declaration file (`MyClass.h`) and a definition file (`MyClass.cpp`) for implentation.

### Namespaces

All classes, structs, enums and global/static functions must be wrapped in the `SixSense` namespace. Extension functions must be added to the `ext` namespace.

### Naming Conventions

The following naming conventions are used:
* Use [`PascalCase`](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/programming-naming-conventions-explained/) for all class and struct names.
* Use [`camelCase`](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/programming-naming-conventions-explained/) for all public scope functions and variables.
* Use underscore-prefixed [`_camelCase`](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/programming-naming-conventions-explained/) for all private and protected scope functions and variables.
* Use [`snake_case_t`](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/programming-naming-conventions-explained/) for type definitions, including the `_t` at the end. 
* Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for preprocessor directives/defines, enum values and enum titles.

### Code Documentation

* Code must be fully documented in [doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) compatible style to allow generation of API documentation.
* Versioning follows the [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/). The `CHANGELOG.md` must be maintained and shorthand dot points on code changes must be added for every version. Contributors may not use release version numbers (e.g. `1.0.1`, or `1.0.1+12`) but should use the pre-release post script, e.g. `1.0.1-3`.
* Version numbers must always be updated in the `library.json` file.

## Checklists

Please use the checklists below before commening work as they will be applied during review of all pull requests.

### Pull-request Checklist

  1. Do all decleration (.h) files have `header guards` consistent with the file name. Format to use is `MY_FILE_NAME_H_`?
  2. Do all files have a metadata block at the top with `@file`, `@mainpage`, `intro_sec_Introduction`, `author` and `license` populated?
  3. Have all debug flags been commented out?
  4. Check all public / protected methods and functions:  
     1. have been fully documented with [doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) tags; and
     2. have `virtual` in front of the definition.
  5. Ensure all classes have a virtual destructor and that the implementation deletes any `FreeRTOS` tasks that were created.
  6. Ensure the `README.md` has been updated:
     1. is the `Description` still valid?
     2. Check for dead links.
     3. Check the `License` terms are correct and consistent.
     4. Make sure the `Usage` is tested and updated.
  7. `CHANGELOG.md` updated:
     1. Add a new [version](https://calver.org/). 
     2. Add a version a title, e.g. "Pre-release, breaking changes".
  8. Make sure the `library.json` is updated:
     1. `version` number consistent with `CHANGELOG.md`;
     2. `description` is still correct;
     3. `keywords` are still correct;
     4. `repository` git link is correct and works;
     5. `dependencies` have been updated, consistent with `platformio.ini`; and
     6. there is no `license` section.
  9.  Update examples in the `/lib/YourLibrary/examples/` folder as `ino` files.
  10. Update tests placed in the `/tests/` folder.

### Device Library Checklist

All libraries that provide an interface with another device and/or peripheral should implement the `SixSense::Device` and `SixSense::iConfiguration` interfaces. See the [example below](#code-example).

  1. Ensure that `platformio.ini` has [https://github.com/SixSenseMarine/SixSense.git](https://github.com/SixSenseMarine/SixSense.git) in the `lib_deps` section.
  2. Run a `Full clean` to rebuild the `/pio/libdeps/` folders.
  2. Do not add `#include <Arduino.h>` to your header files.  It is included by the `Device.h` header file.
  3. Add `SixSense` namespace around all classes, structs and enums.
  4. Add `static String toString(your_enum_t enumVal)` extension functions to all `enum` objects but place them in the `ext` namespace.
  5. Add `iConfiguration` class for the `Device`.
  6. `Device` class declarations must include:
     1. `device_state_t begin()` function.
     2. `iConfiguration * configuration()` getter.


## Code Example


A sample class declaration is shown below:

```C++
/*!
 * @file MyClass.h
 *
 * @mainpage Example implementation class.
 *
 * @section intro_sec_Introduction
 *
 * This simple implementation class defines a configuration class with
 * one property and a device implementation that demonstrates how to use 
 * the configuration class during initialization.
